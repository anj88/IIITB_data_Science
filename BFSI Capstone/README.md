#<b>Problem Statement</b>

<b>Business understanding</b>

CredX is a leading credit card provider that gets thousands of credit card applicants every year. But in the past few years, it has experienced an increase in credit loss. The CEO believes that the best strategy to mitigate credit risk is to ‘acquire the right customers’.
In this project, you will help CredX identify the right customers using predictive models. Using past data of the bank’s applicants, you need to determine the factors affecting credit risk, create strategies to mitigate the acquisition risk and assess the financial benefit of your project.   


<b>Understanding the data</b> 

There are two data sets in this project — demographic and credit bureau data.  

Demographic/application data: This is obtained from the information provided by the applicants at the time of credit card application. It contains customer-level information on age, gender, income, marital status, etc.
Credit bureau: This is taken from the credit bureau and contains variables such as 'number of times 30 DPD or worse in last 3/6/12 months', 'outstanding balance', 'number of trades', etc.


<b>Application scorecard</b>

Build an application scorecard with the good to bad odds of 10 to 1 at a score of 400 doubling every 20 points.  
For the rejected population, calculate the application scores and assess the results. Compare the scores of the rejected population with the approved candidates and comment on the observations.
On the basis of the scorecard, identify the cut-off score below which you would not grant credit cards to applicants.
