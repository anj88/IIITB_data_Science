<b>Business Problem</b>
  
Business understanding:

“Global Mart” is an online store super giant having worldwide operations. It takes orders and delivers across the globe and deals with all the major product categories - consumer, corporate & home office.

Now as a sales/operations manager, you want to finalise the plan for the next 6 months.  So, you want to forecast the sales and the demand for the next 6 months, that would help you manage the revenue and inventory accordingly.
